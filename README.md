# SSAI Project

###Task:
Setup a simple Drupal CMS website using MAMP/WAMP and MySQL. Demonstrate front-end skills (jQuery, CSS, HTML, Twig) by applying your own custom Drupal theme.

Create a content type called users. In that content type, add the following fields: First Name, Last Name, Phone number, (etc). Please demonstrate familiarity with HTML Twig by creating a custom view that displays all users (first names concatenated last names). Make use of CSS classes for a responsive design.  And finally, use jQuery to make a tool-tip to display the users phone number on hover.
